                            Since 9th grade was online, I had a lot of freedom with how I did things. 
                            For example, I was able to work on things throughout the day without worrying about transit to and from school. 
                            However, group work was a pain. Many people refused to participate and it was hard to enjoy the work. 
                            Out of these classes, I enjoyed my concurrent enrollment classes for math, my LA class, Intro to Design, and AP Geo the most. 
                            I enjoy math and the logic that connects everything togther, so the challenging 1050-1060 math course was actually quite fun to work through with my friends. 
                            I also enjoyed my LA class becuase of the teacher; he taught us a lot about how to be concise and how to write better while also pushing us to view works in a different light. 
                            AP Geo was interesting because of the content; through this class, we looked further into things that are not really that deeply thought about. 
                            Finally, I love art so Intro to Design was a fun class.

                        <p>
                            First off, it was a little hard to adjust to the differences this year. 
                            For example, almost all of the assignments are all online or on Canvas which was new. 
                            My favorite classes this year was AP Calc, Chemistry, and Art. 
                            As usual, I just really enjoyed the math, and I also really like how this teacher teaches.
                            I am surprised, but I really loved chemistry this year. 
                            I expected to like physics or biology but I definitely liked chemistry more. 
                            In a way, chemistry is similar to math; it has its own logic and style.
                            In drawing and painting this year, I was able to learn a lot of new techniques!!
                            I also got to use oil paints which was very exciting. 
                            Another interesting change this year happened in Chinese. 
                            The teacher started making us do oral assignments where we film ourselves doing the homework orally.
                            To be honest, I didn't really enjoy this since I like writing the characters better; however, I can't deny it was a good way to improve my skill.
                            I want to make sure I keep practicing.
                            Computer Programming got me further interested into coding, but it felt too easy.

                            Although I didn't participate in any clubs last year, I had a lot of fun in my clubs this year!! 
                            Beamline was a fun particle physics club where we competed with other teams worldwide for a chance to do our experiment at CERN.
                            (Our experiment is linked <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ziNtfb_qZrOAierfB0FUOCSxfpTx-DzAsoEdJg9WNE4/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">here</a> if interested.) 
                            I also loved my experience in Key Club, Hope Squad, and Tutoring since I was able to see and feel the impact I had by helping other people within these clubs.
                            Book Club was a club that I co-founded with a close friend, and although it wasn't as proffessional as a book club usually is, it was a great way to relax during our busy school lives and have fun with new people.

                                Although particle physics sounds increidbly daunting, we all helped each other and made it fun like in this video.
                                I learned a lot, and I really enjoyed my time here. Once again the link to our paper proposal is

                                I decided to take these classes over the summer since they are classes that are required for me to graduate or get my license;
                                however, at the same time, they are classes that I don't want to use up my periods for.
                                For the most part these classes were not that bad and since I was able to go through the content at my own pace, I think I retained the information better.

                                Although summer is a great opportunity to expand your skills and learn more about college, I did not realize what I was missing,
                                so this year I started small by signing up for a free CTS course and the summer classes mentioned above.
                                I had a lot of fun with this course!! It wasn't until earlier this school year when I realized that coding would probably be the best option for me,
                                so this class taught me a lot about front-end designers and what it takes to build a website. But I loved it, and it encouraged me to make this website!!

                            I had a lot of challenging classes this year, but I had fun in all of them. 
                            First thng to note, is that I took a college class using the High School Universities Program. 
                            It was a new experience that really showcased the different teaching style and struggles in a college class. 
                            I also had IB classes this year. These classes posed a different challenge for me as they were significantly more intensive and thorough than other classes. 
                            For example in IB Chinese, I focused a lot on my ability to express myself in Chinese more so than learning new vocabulary. 
                            I learned a lot in these classes as well; I learned completely new techniques and structures in IB Computer Science, 
                            and underwent completely new teaching styles and methods in my other IB classes. 
                            Although I needed to take both U.S. Gov and Yoga to graduate, I had a lot of fun in these classes and was able to bond and relax with new people.

                            I kept going with the clubs I enjoyed and joined NHS and Writer's Club since they alligned well with my interests. 
                            I was also the social media officer for Hope Squad this year which was a great opportunity. 
                            With Hope Squad I was able to go to middle schools and talk about Hope Squad and its role and even visit health classes and speak on my own experiences.

                                Once again, we had an absolute blast in Beamline this year. 
                                We were lucky enough to even be able to go the Huntsman Cancer Institute to lern more about the use of particle physics in chemotherapy.

                                I have had a lot of fun being able to participate in all we did, from shoutouts to clothing drives, from mental health presentations to giant jenga!
                                I especially loved being able to work with Romaina and Emma (last photo), or our club president and vice president to make the club so much fun.

                                By now, all the members are very comfortable with each other so we had a lot of fun reading and discussing our books. 
                                We also decided to show off our favorite books in our yearbook photo and even got our own feature.
